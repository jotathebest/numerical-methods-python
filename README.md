##Numerical methods in Python

This repository began in a saturday night when I just wanted to program something. I like maths so I decide to make the algorithms of Numerical Methods for engineers of Chapra and Canale available in other language different of MATLAB, for this purpose I'll use Python.

The methods will be divided as suggested in the book, so first I will make the methods for find roots, then optimization and so on.

This repository will be updated as soon as my personal time lets me.

Any doubt feel free to write me: reyes2000jose@gmail.com

## How to use

Look at the .py file called 'examples', there you can find some examples of the book implemented. 

All the methods are written in the 'methods' files, so for example, for finding roots methods  you will see a rootsMethods.py file, simply import it for your own scripts.

Keep in mind that you must implement your functions to fit the methods, take a look to the objectiveFunctions file for examples.
